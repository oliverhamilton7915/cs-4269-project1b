This repository contains two files: group7_project1b.py and World.py. The former is the driver class and the latter is defines our World and Country class. Each country has certain 'basic' and 'created' resources that are weighted by the scalars represented by RESOURCE_WEIGHTS in World.py. A countries utility is the weighted sum of its possessed resources. The world class governs the countries and helps us model the acceptance probabilities of trades.

To run the program, simply execute group7_project.py
